    <h1>Home Made Smash Burger</h1>
    <img src="./burger.jpg" alt="a delectable homemade treat" />
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      As I am writing this, I had just devoured 3 chicken burritos from taco
      bell and I am unable to provide a compelling description for this
      otherwise appetizing recipe. Nevertheless, had my stomach been empty, this
      recipe would not be my first pick for a hearty and wholesome meal but
      maybe after a long and tiresome week, I think I would be deserving of this
      gluttonous meal.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
      <li>2 tbsp of butter</li>
      <li>1 lb ground chuck beef</li>
      <li>4-6 in squares parchment paper</li>
      <li>salt</li>
      <li>4 slices of American cheese</li>
      <li>burger topping of choice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Set a
        cast iron flat-top griddle or large cast iron skillet onto the grill and
        preheat until smoking.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread butter on the inside of the buns and toast on the flat-top until
        lightly browned. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Form meat into 8 loosely-packed balls, 2 ounces each. Do not pack the
        meat tightly, as this will prevent it from smashing properly. Place each
        ball on the hot flat-top, cover with a piece of parchment (to prevent
        sticking to the spatula; re-use each parchment square on a second patty)
        and immediately smash down to a 1/4 inch thickness using 2 stiff, sturdy
        spatulas that are criss-crossed to get proper leverage as you press
        down. You may also use the bottom of small skillet. Sprinkle the meat
        with salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Grill for about 45 seconds, until the edges are dark brown and the
        centers are a light pink color. Using a bench scraper or firm spatula,
        gently scrape up the patties, flip over and immediately cover 4 of them
        with cheese. Grill an additional 15 to 20 seconds; stack the plain
        patties over the cheese-covered patties so you have 4 stacks. Move each
        stack to a bun and serve with your favorite toppings.
      </li>
    </ol>
