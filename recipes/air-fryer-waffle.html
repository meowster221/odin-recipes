  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    If you're incredibly poor like me or simply don't care about food that
    tastes good give this recipe a try.
  </p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 frozen waffle</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>salt and pepper</li>
    <li>2 tbsp of shredded cheese</li>
    <li>maple syrup</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
    <li>
      Cut a hole in the center of the frozen waffle using the rim of a cup or
      glass (about 2 to 3 inches in diameter). Move waffle to a square of
      parchment paper, then carefully place the parchment paper into the
      preheated air fryer, along with the small center waffle.
    </li>
    <li>
      Crack egg directly into the center of waffle hole; season with salt and
      pepper to taste. Close the lid and cook until the white of the egg has
      started to set, about 5 to 6 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Remove small center waffle from the air fryer. Sprinkle shredded cheese
      onto egg waffle, and cook until the cheese is melted and egg white is
      completely set, about 1 to 2 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Transfer egg waffle onto a plate; drizzle with maple syrup and serve
      immediately.
    </li>
  </ol>
